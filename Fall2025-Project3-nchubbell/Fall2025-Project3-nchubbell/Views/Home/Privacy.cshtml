                        The application stores the information you enter about movies and actors,
                        including titles, genres, years, names, ages, and links such as IMDb URLs.

                    <p>
                        Movie reviews and actor tweets are generated using Azure OpenAI services.
                        These generated texts are stored in the database along with sentiment
                        scores computed by Vader sentiment analysis.
